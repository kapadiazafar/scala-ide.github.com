The Scala IDE for Eclipse could not be where it is today without the continued support from the community. A considerable amount of time has gone into making the Scala IDE for Eclipse a reliable IDE for doing your daily Scala coding, and that has been possible thanks to the tremendous effort made by each contributor. Thanks for the passion, energy and time you all donated to this project.
