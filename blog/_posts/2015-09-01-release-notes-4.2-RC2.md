[Scala IDE 4.2-RC1][release] arrived about two weeks ago and since then a few improvements were made. Especially the new Async Debugger got stronger. If you tried 4.2-RC1 please also try 4.2-RC2 and report back anything that doesnâ€™t work the way it should. See the [changelog][chl] for an overview of all changes in 4.2-RC2.

This is the second release candidate and if no further blockers are found during the next week or so, it will become the final release.
