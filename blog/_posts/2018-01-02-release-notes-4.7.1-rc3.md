We have the great pleasure to inform you about Scala IDE 4.7.1 RC3 release. This time we decided to allow for <b>macro expansion in Worksheet</b> to enable it for <b>Spark</b> development. Besides this we put some effort to make Worksheet more stable and added more meaningful errors reporting.

## New and Noteworthy

Worksheet can work with Spark projects in scala 2.11.
