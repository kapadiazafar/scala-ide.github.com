Scala IDE 4.1-RC1 arrived last week and since then a few regressions were found by our users. We were busy fixing all of them in order to give you an even better release. If you tried 4.1-RC1 please also try 4.1-RC2 and report back anything that doesn't work the way it should. See the [changelog][chl] for an overview of all changes in 4.1-RC2.

This is the second release candidate and if no further blockers are found during the next week or so, it will become the final release.
