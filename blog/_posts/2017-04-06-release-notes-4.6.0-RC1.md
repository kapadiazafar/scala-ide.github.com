title: Scala IDE 4.6.0-RC1 is out!

We have the great pleasure to give into your hands the latest Scala IDE which is fully compatible with Scala 2.12. This time we have devoted almost all our efforts to migrate Scala IDE functionality to Scala 2.12 together with related plugins. So Search, Worksheet, ScalaTest and Refactoring plugins are now available for the newest Scala version! Unfortunately we could not be able to deliver you Play 2 because supported versions of Play (2.3 and 2.4) in Scala IDE 4.5.0 are no longer supported by Play for Scala 2.12. So you can expect very soon support for 2.5 and 2.6 Play versions, the only two which are compiled with Scala 2.12.

Besides aforementioned areas we traditionally added a bunch of smaller fixes and enhancements into existing functionalities.

Finally as always, we are aware that Scala IDE still needs improvements, especially now, and we assure you that we are doing our best to deliver the most reliable and handy tool as possible, with your help as well. Enjoy.

## New and Noteworthy

### Improved Refactoring Support

There are so many tiny improvements in our logic that it is difficult to mention them all here but you can take a look at our [changelog][cl] to find out which changes there are exactly. They may still not be perfect - but we came a lot closer.

## Stats

For the full list of all changes, see the [changelog][cl].
