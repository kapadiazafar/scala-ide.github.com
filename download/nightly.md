### Requirements

* Scala IDE Lithium works with [Eclipse 4.5][mars], [Eclipse 4.4][luna] and [Eclipse 4.2][juno],[4.3][kepler]. Because of binary incompatibilities between these releases, Juno and Kepler builds use a different update site.

## Eclipse Luna (4.4) and Eclipse Mars (4.5)

This is a version of the Scala IDE that works with the most recent versions of Eclipse.
